# COMP1400CommandLineCalculator

This is my command line calculator for my COMP1400 course in University.  
There were 3 assignments for this calculator:
- **Assignment 1:** create a calculator that only prints the beginning text. Everything else write in pseudocode as comments.
- **Assignment 2:** create the calculator.
- **Assignment 3:** add memory capabilities to the calculator and make each operation as a function.
